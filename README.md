# lxcenter-taidos

Repo of all RPM's of Lxcenter.org

Temporary download link is still thier server:

http://66.160.179.101/download/update/

http://75.98.169.138/download/update/


Its better keeping all RPM's for further development.

My repo:

https://ip-television.ml/repo (sorry was what i found free for me to put the files in)

If you want to install it and test like i am doing please do it:

yum-config-manager --add-repo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taidos/lxcenter-repo/master/lxcenter.repo

or

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taidos/lxcenter-repo/master/lxcenter.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/lxcenter.repo

My work on HyperVM is migrated to a new fresh and more clean repository: https://github.com/taidos/hypervm-taidos

All the needed files for installation are there and with the new way of installing trow git, all files will be stored only on github to not harm the needed uptime, updates on all files (bug's and fixes) will be automaticly updated on every new installation!
